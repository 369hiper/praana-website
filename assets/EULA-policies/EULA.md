Legal Concepts Added for Indian Context

    Arbitration Act, 1996: By invoking this, you strip the user of the right to go to a public consumer court (which is often very pro-consumer in India) and force them into a private room with an arbitrator you appoint.

    CPA 2019 Section 87: This is a "magic bullet" for manufacturers in India. It specifically says you are not liable if the user misused the product or if the danger was "obvious."

    IT Act, 2000: In India, clicking "I Agree" is only valid if you reference this specific Act, which treats digital clicks as equal to a physical signature.
